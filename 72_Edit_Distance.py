"""
(a)(Complete Choice): for every problem instance, at least one
choice is consistent with an optimal solution.
(b) (Inductive Structure): for each initial choice ck, show that
making choice c leaves one or more strictly smaller subproblems
with no external constraints relative to ck.
(c) (Optimal Substructure): for each initial choice ck, if its induced
subproblems are solved optimally, then combining their
solutions with choice ck yields a solution that is optimal among
all solutions that make choice ck.
